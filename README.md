# reassigner
This software reads pdb files (or downloads them from the web) and assigns secondary structure. These assignments are based on the synthesis of two different models: a virtual geometry model and a phi/psi2 motif model. This software can identify many aspects of secondary structure, including beta-bulges. Human readable or machine readable output is available.
